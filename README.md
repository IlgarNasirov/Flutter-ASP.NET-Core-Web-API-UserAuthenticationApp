This is a user authentication project. There are Flutter and ASP.NET-Core-Web-API projects inside this project. The client can login, register, logout and get username via the Server. The Server can also create new JSON Web Token for user's refresh token. This means you don't need to login and register for an application again and again. You need to add SQL backup file to your Microsoft SQL Server application for using this Server project. I used bcrypt(for hashing password), JSON Web Token(for authentication and authorization), Entity Framework Core(as an ORM framework) with database first approach and Microsoft SQL Server(as a database) in the Server project. I used http(for sending http request via Flutter) and flutter_secure_storage(for storing user's tokens) in the client project.
